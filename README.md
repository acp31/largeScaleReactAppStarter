# largeScaleReactAppStarter
a simple starter for a large scale react application using Graphql and Relay from Facebook

RGR set up, We are going away from the MVC model to design an application that can be scaled up to a very large size;

I am trying to see if I will use GraphQl instead of Rest APIs
