# largeScaleReactAppStarter
a simple starter for a large scale react application using Graphql

We are going away from the MVC model to design an application that can be scaled up to a very large size;

I am trying to see if I will use RGR stack instead of Rest APIs


To see the app in action run:

1. npm install

2. npm run dev

3. go to http://localhost:4000/
